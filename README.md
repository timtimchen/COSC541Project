# Project - Interaction Techniques for Unreachable Objects on the Touchscreen

The App in this repository is built for a HCI research project in the UBC COSC 541 course. It is to develop demostrations of eight interaction techniques with one-hand handling on a large cell phone torchscreen. It also has functionality to gather user testing data and evaluation for user studying purpose.


## Development Environment and Deployment

This app is developed in the Android Studio and it is suppose to run on a smartphone with an Android 5.0+ operation system. Since this research is focus on unreachable Objects on a large touchscreen, the best practical running platform would be a cellphone with 6.0+ inches screen and 1080 x 2160 resolution.

To setup and test this App, first we will need to download (or clone) all files in this repository and then use the "import project" option in the Android Studio File menu to load and setup the project. To test the app, we will need to create a virtual device, i.g. Pixel 3a XL, using the "Device Manager" tool in the Android Studio, or connect a physical smart phone to our workstation with a USB cable (in this way you will need to open debug mode option in your cell phone security settings). When this device (either the virtual or physical one) is turned on and connected to the device manager in Android Studio, the app is ready to run on it by choosing the "run app" option in the menu.

Another way to deploy this app to a smart cell phone is to build a APK file (installation package) by Android Studio, and then send the APK file to an Android cell phone and install the APK on it. After that, this App can run on the cell phone like normal apps.
